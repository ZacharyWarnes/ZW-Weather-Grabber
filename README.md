 ## **Description**

 The ZW-Weather Grabber is an application that allows you to search for the weather by entering in the name of a city. By utilizing API calls, we are able to fetch coordinates by our city name entry and call the local weather information for those coordinates. The ZW-Weather Grabber saves your searches to local storage so you can search them again later.
